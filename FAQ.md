# FAQ

> Could I be banned from VRChat for using this SDK?  
- There is no known mechanism available to VRChat to detect which SDK you decide to use. It will appear as if you are using the default SDK, so a ban is highly unlikely.

> My avatar won't upload! There's an error.  
- Usually caused by missing/empty/broken components and compile errors, check your console to find the cause before raising an issue.

> What can the SDX do?  
- It bypasses some limits which exist in the default SDK and provides several additional features.

> Why does it take so long to import?  
- There are many DLLs and Scripts; Unity executes them in the editor, so they are compiled during import.

> Why SDX,  not SDK?  
- Initially, it was the Standard Development kit eXtreme. This name has remained.

> Why does it not import?  
- Unity sometimes doesn't have the correct permissions it needs to import assets, try and restart Unity, your PC, or create a new project.

> Uploading gives me an error  
- Remove the Blueprint ID on the avatar/world and try again.

> The SDK won't load even when imported!  
- Look for compile errors in the console; they prevent Unity from loading Scripts and DLLs, also check for missing Scripts and DLLs by reimporting the SDX.

> May I make changes and distribute them?  
- You may fork this repository and make changes; however, this is with the understanding you have no rights to the source code?

> Is there a paid version?  
- No, 'nor do I plan to do this; however, donations are welcome.

> Someone is rebranding your SDK and is not giving credit/selling it!  
- Please report this to me immediately via Discord, the link is in the readme.

> I can't find the control panel!  
- See the menu bar, and find it in the following path: Phoenix > SDK > Control Panel.

> Why do you have my assets in your SDK? Can you remove them?  
- Of course; contact me on Discord, explain to me which assets are involved, and we'll sort it out.

> Are you logging my information?  
- No

> The Control Panel has no buttons!  
- There's a Unity theme issue which causes this, navigate to the SDX Settings and click `Reset Color` to fix this.

> The World Upload Panel is missing the UPLOAD button!  
- It is hidden until you toggle the ToS consent box.
