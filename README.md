# SDK2 is now DEPRICATED  
As VRChat has depricated the official VRCSDK2 I have also depricated my modded SDK2  
TBASDX2 will still get updates but nowhere near as often as the newer SDK3 builds  
VRChat plans to cut off SDK2 uploads, I have no choice on what to do here  

## The Black Arms ToolKit  
The toolkit is basically the center of the new system  
You can import the toolkit then pick the SDK you want to import from there  
Do NOT mix UDON with Avatar3, your project WILL BREAK  
You can still import either SDK from the packages if you would like  
The Toolkit also works with new VRChat official SDKs without having to wait!  
The Toolkit does not depend on the SDK revisions presented here  
The Toolkit will remain updated on a timely basis  

# OVERHAUL UNDERWAY  
The Entire SDX is now undergoing a TOTAL OVERHAUL  
Do not expect any serious updates until then  
Revision 3 is coming soon  

# VRCHAT UPGRADED TO UNITY 2019  
Full support is already available as the SDX is already at RELEASE STATUS for the 2019 Upgrade  
Be sure you are running Unity 2019.4.29f1  
We will be upgrading the SDX soon to implement many things
