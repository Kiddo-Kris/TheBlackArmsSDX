This is a list of everything that I plan to have in The Black Arms SDX (This list can change as time goes)

Rainbow Hierarchy
Fully Colorable UI (Affecting Unity UI)
Integrated Play Mode Saver
Internal Downloads (Downloads to project and then imports instead of Externally downloading)
Support from 2017 to latest
UDON support
Undetectable Uploads (Impossible to be banned)
Obfuscated Project System (Prevent users from stealing assets remotely)
RGB UI (Because I Can)
Automated Prefab Unpacking in Hierarchy
Automated Removal of Empty/Missing/Broken Components
Detailed Error output for reporting issues (Must enable manually so people dont say im logging their shit, Security is Priority)
Obfuscated Upload Method (For those who want to protect their work, Must enable manully)
Customizable Upload UIs (Hoping to make a script to load a editor for that within unity)
Customizable DiscordRPC (Will still say I made it via the small icon but the rest you can go wild with!)
Keyframing tools and utilities (I know its hard to keyframe so I am developing tools and utilities to make it easier)
Quest Shader Limit Bypass (Nearly done, Doing a GHOST METHOD for that)
Easy Alt Manager (We know someone is gonna have a fuck ton of accounts)
User Tips (To help the new creators get started!)
AUTO UPDATES (Hopefully I can get that going)
Release Channel Switch (To channel between Stable, Beta, and Alpha all from within unity via Auto Updates)
TESTING MODE (Not play mode, TESTING MODE will enable full avatar testing as if you were in game just now within unity!)
Automatic Dark Mode (I dont know if its possible but ill try!)
Expanded Assets Panel (Planning to make it much much larger, this will take alot of work)
Multi-Tier UI Coloring (Make each part of the UNITY UI individually Colorable)
Heavily Optimized Bundling Methods (Attempting to make the time between clicking “Upload” and seeing the UPLOAD PANEL as short as possible)
Advanced Unity Recovery (Hoping to make it so that unity crashing can be avoided so people dont lose progress)
Automated Backups (Saved your work for you and makes Backups actively to a directory of your choosing, Must be enabled manually)
Unified Shader Editor (A Universal Shader Editor to make it as easy and simple as possible to edit shader properties on materials)
Animated Control Panel (Animations for the Control Panel instead of the static transitionless one)
Full Control Panel Revamp (Plans to make a brand new Control Panel with a Theme Editor for it to induce max creativity!)
Custom UI Fonts (Enable the ability to change all the text throughout the entire UI for projects with the SDX to use any font you want given they’re supported)
Online Systems (Plans to make the SDX have its own online service to share themes and configs, Help each other, and to Sync Settings between devices, Most likely will require you to make a separate account for this to work
Custom Upload Background/Music Importer (Planning to make a script to import custom MP3/MP4 files to the upload panel assets to enable the ability to customize the SDX further)
Scaling to fit any 16:9 Resolution on upload panels (anything bigger the default resolution will work, anything smaller will not)
Animated banners on the Control Panel (Wanting to see if I can use GIFs on the Control Panel banners)
Script to use different arrangements of the upload panels for different aspect ratios (so other resolutions are supported instead of only 16:9 resolutions)
